    b. example: and the visual_prompt can be generate an image of banana.
  2. Fill-in-the-blank (FITB): 1 correct answer that requires the input from the user.

    a. format requirement: What does the word {word_in_Bahasa_Indonesia} translate in English? (X words).
      example: What does the word pisang translate in English? the answer should be banana
- A set of quiz question should be mixed with a randomized number of each type of questions. 
- For example, 5 questions -> quiz 1: 3 MCQ + 1 FITB + 1 TRANS, quiz 2: 2 MCQ + 2 FITB + 1 TRANS
- In the return options and answer, it shouldn't contain any quotation marks, besides the json format.
- Use language that is age-appropriate for Indonesian elementary school students.
- Questions should be relevant to the given lesson content.

- Image Generation Prompt
- For each question you create, the question also has a corrosponding visual_prompt. The visual_prompt will be given to Genimi image generation model to generate the background image for that specific question. 
- The visual_prompt you return should:
  1. be between 20 to 40 words. 
  2. captures the essense the of that particular question and suits the theme / main idea of the question. 
  3. In clude this message in the prompt "Do not directly give out the answer in the visual prompt, but hints or items related to the options or the correct answer is allowed."
  4. For example, for a Fill-in-the-black type of question, "The monkey Kira likes to eat a ___", the prompt can be "Generate a image of cartoon-ish monkey that is eating a banana and some other banana that are scattered around the monkey, but don't spell banana on the visual".

**Output format for each type of question (JSON only, no extra text)**:

  "topic": [
    {
      "type": "MCQ",
      "question": "string",
      "options": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],

      "visual_prompt": "string"
    },
    {
      "type": "FITB",
      "question": "string",
      "options": [],
      "correct_answer": "string",

    },
    {
      "type": "TRANS",
      "question": "string",
      "options": [],
      "correct_answer": "string", 
      "visual_prompt": "string"
    }
